				<p style="text-indent:35px;"> 
					Alan Mathison Turing was borned in 23 June 1912 in London. He was a famuos English mathematician, computer scientist and cryptologist. As we know it, he is like that founder of computer scientist.

 			                    Alan Turing invented The Turing Machine which is a virtual machine and has lots of contributions at computer science. This machine does a calculation method with following specific process. Besides, 
large of numbers are not important for this machine. The most important thing is that whether this machine can solve the problems in limited duration or not. Moreover, this machine produces not only solution but also it proves to whether this problem can be solved or not such as halting problem. On the other hand, it is a significant problem which shows whether computer has thinking skill or not. This answer was changed from person to person until Turing answered it. 
Turing’s Text has sold this issue. Artificial intelligence and computer science was arised thanks to Alan Turing. He proved that a computer runs as an intelligent living creature does. Even currently  CAPTCHA called an application is based on basis of Turing Text, is used for understand being internet users are human or else 
machine.Otherwise, during the second world war, Alan Turing solved algorithm of famuos cipher machine which is Enigma of German. He contributed to do the electromagnetics  machine which is named Bombe. This machine is useful to break a code by produced Enigma. So that, He was chosen a war hero by the help of his succes of during war.

			In 1952, he was put on trial due to being homesexual. During one year, he was convicted to inject of oestrogen. Besides, the name of turing award was given because of him. In 1954, he died due to suicide.  To sum up, Alan Mathison Turing has a substantial place in computer science. He contributed many things for our future. Nowadays, all of us use computer and algorithm thanks to him. Shortly, As trainee computer science students we must know his contributions for computer science.
